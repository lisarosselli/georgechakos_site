By the end of this project, you'll        have installed some tools, debugged and fixed some code, and packaged it        for handing in. Note: The tasks 1â€“5 below are completed in the PartA folder; task 6 is completed in the PartB folder. </p>      <h3>What you need to do:</h3>      <ol>        <li>Examine this package</li>        <li>Get a code editor</li>        <li>Get Firefox &amp; Firebug</li>        <li>Find and fix the bugs</li>        <li>Prepare your homework package to submit</li>        <li>Convert a JSFiddle example into local code</li>      </ol>      <h4>1. Examine this package</h4>      <p>Unzip this package into a folder. Look at its structure&mdash;all of the        homework projects will be distributed in this way, and it's typical of        how the various resources used by a web page are organized.&nbsp; For        undergraduate students, you'll submit your assignments in a zip file        with this exact file/folder structure. </p>      <h4>2. Get a code editor</h4>      <p>Download a code editor of your choice. Notepad and TextEdit aren't code        editors. See the Week 1, Lesson 2 in Canvas and Chapter 3 of the textbook for advice. I'm partial to        TextWrangler/BBEdit on the Mac, or Komodo Edit on Mac or Windows, but        there are many and it's largely a personal preference.&nbsp; An IDE is        not necessary, and will just complicate things at this point.</p>      <h4>3. Make sure you have Firefox &amp; Firebug and can find and open the Chrome Developer Tools</h4>      <p>The recommended browser/debug environment for this course is Firefox        with the Firebug extension, along with Google Chrome and its built-in tools.        &nbsp; Other browsers have debug tools, too, but        there's nothing quite like Firebug.&nbsp; Download the latest Firefox        for your computer and install the Firebug extension (select Add-Ons in Firefox and then search for Firebug).      Instructions for this can be found in Week 2 of the course.</p>      <p>Once you have your debugging tools and an editor, you're ready for the next step. </p>      <h4>4. Find and fix a bug</h4>      If you're not already viewing this file in Firefox, open it in Firefox and      open Firebug. Also, open this folder in your Finder or Windows Explorer,      and open the PartA/js/project1.js file in your code editor. <br>      <br>      In Firebug, look at the different tabs and page elements. You can see      everything here: HTML, Javascript, and CSS code. Open the SCRIPT tab and      find the javascript file associated with this page. Look at the Network      tab and see how every element of this page is listed. <br>      <h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bug #1 (50 pts)<br>        </span></h5>      Click the Click me #1 button on this page. Nothing happens! I must have      introduced a bug in my code. You're going to fix it.<br>      &nbsp;<br>      <div id="clickme1" class="hwbutton">Click Me #1</div>      <br>      <br>      Use FireBug's console to see if there's an error message.&nbsp; That      should help narrow down the problem to the particular section or line of the      code. <br>      <br>      Look at the code and see if anything looks obviously wrong&mdash;misspellings      of reserved words or function names, malformed code. You shouldn't need      any special knowledge of Javascript to find this one&mdash;it should be      fairly clear.&nbsp; <br>      <br>      Look at the project1.js in your code editor. Don't worry about the rest of the      code&mdash;you're not supposed to understand all that just yet (though you      will in a few weeks!) Just look for an obvious error near the line that's      failing.<br>      <br>      Fix it, save it, and reload this page to try again.<br>      You might have to Shift-Reload to be sure the JS file refreshes.<br>      <br>      If it's working, you will see three consecutive alert messages in your      browser. If you want to run it again, reload the page. <br>      <h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bug #2 (50pts)<br>        </span></h5>      Now let's try another. Let's add three numbers.<br>      Fill in a non-zero integer into each of the three boxes and click the      Click Me #2 button. <br>      <input id="input1" type="number"><input id="input2" type="number"><input id="input3"        type="number"><br>      <div>Your total is: <span id="resultArea"></span></div>      <div id="clickme2" class="hwbutton">Click Me #2</div>      <br>      <br>      Does the total look right?&nbsp; (Hint: it does not!)&nbsp; Look in the      console for an error and you'll notice that nothing is there. This is because the code      is typed just fine. There are no errors in the code itself that prevent      the browser from executing it. But there's an error in logic&mdash;the code I      wrote doesn't do what I wanted it to do (which is to add three      integers).&nbsp; Find the problem, fix it, save it, and reload the page to      test it.&nbsp; You might have to Shift-Reload to be sure the JS file      refreshes.<br>      <br>      <h4>5. Prepare PartA of your project by adding your name</h4>      Make one more HTML change on this part of your project. This will help us to be sure you're      comfortable with HTML, as well as identify your work when we're reviewing and      grading this assignment.&nbsp; Open PartA/project1.html in your editor and add a DIV      section near the top (look for the instructions in the comments) with the      id attribute equal to "studentname" (not your name, the actual string      "studentname"), the class attribute equal to "namedata" (again, not your      name, but the literal text "namedata"), and with your name as the contents      (yes, here you put your actual name).&nbsp; Save the file. If you've got      it right, the top of your page should have something that looks like this.      The styling is being applied by our CSS&mdash;if you've got the DIV tag, ID      and CLASS assigned correctly, it will have this color, size and      background.<br>      <br>      <img title="Screenshot of correct HTML implementation " alt="Example of what the new DIV will look like if implemented correctly."        src="img/namediv-example.png"><br>      <h4>6. Convert a JSFiddle example into local code and submit project</h4>      In this last problem, you get to show that you understand the way the files      in a web application are arranged.  In the previous example, you had to unzip a      set of HTML, JS and CSS files. That directory structure is how the problem sets in      this course will be arranged. <br><br>      Your assignment is to convert an example on JSFiddle into one that runs locally on your computer,      according to the directory structure example we've given you.  This is something you'll have to do      from time to time. Debugging code inside of JSFiddle can be very difficult, and often you have to      copy it down to run locally in order to fix it. Your steps may look something like this:      <ol><li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cscie3/zznow3ne/" title="Link to JSFiddle assignment">Start with this JSFiddle</a>, which includes      HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li><li> Open the PartB folder from the project folder you unzipped. Inside this folder, create folders called js      and css.</li>        <li>At the root of this folder, make a file called index.html which contains      the HTML from the JSFiddle example.      </li>        <li>Inside the js folder, make a js file that contains the Javascript from the JSFiddle; and inside the css folder        make a css file that contains the CSS from the JSFiddle. You may call these files whatever you want, but be sure they        end with the .js and .css extensions. </li>        <li>Now you'll need to edit your HTML file. Add the SCRIPT tag that loads your .js file, and add the LINK tag that loads your        .css file. </li>        <li>Test your html file in the browser and make sure it works and looks the same as the output section        of the JSFiddle example. </li>        <li>      Zip up the whole project folder into a new zip file named      "lastname_firstname.projectUnit1a.zip" (you should substitute your own first and last names here!) and submit that as the Unit 1 Project on the class      site in Canvas.</li>      </ol>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <p><br>      </p>    </div>    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/project1.js"></script>  </body></html>
